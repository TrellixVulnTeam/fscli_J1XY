Through local debugging capabilities, the SCF CLI can run code in a local simulation environment, send simulated test events, and get the running log of the function code and information such as time-consuming and memory usage.

## Dependent component

Native debugging does not need to rely on Docker, just ensure that the environment is already installed on the system. The current native command only supports Node.js and Python runtime. To ensure consistent deployment of the cloud and the local version, it is recommended that the local version of the runtime and the cloud version be the same. For example, if you are using Node.js 6.10 in the cloud, this machine is also recommended to install Node.js 6.x.

## Debug command

The scf cli completes the local trigger run by the `native invoke ` subcommand. The scf command line tool will run the corresponding cloud in the specified directory of the machine according to the specified function template configuration file, and implement the local cloud function simulation run through the specified trigger event.

### Parameter Description

The parameters supported by the `scf native invoke` command are as follows:

Parameter | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | ---
event | no | The source of the file for the simulated test event, the file content must be in JSON format | event.json
template | no | The path or file name of the configuration file. The default is template.yaml | template.yaml
env-vars | no | The environment variable configuration when the function is running, you need to specify the environment variable configuration file, the content must be in JSON format. | env.json
Debug-port | no | The port exposed when the function is running. After the port is specified, the local runtime will start in debug mode and expose the specified port. | 3366
debug-args | no | The debugger startup parameters in this machine. After the parameter is specified, the specified parameters will be passed when the debugger starts. | 

The support option FUNCTION_IDENTIFIER is described as follows:

Parameter | Required | Description | Example
--- | --- | --- | ---
FUNCTION_IDENTIFIER | no | Indicates the identifier and name of the function; if there are multiple function descriptions in the project description configuration file, you can use this parameter to specify the function to be debugged. | Hello_world

### Test simulation event

The simulation event used to trigger the cloud function locally can be passed through the command pipeline of linux or passed through a file.

- **Passing through the command pipeline:** The {coded1}scf native invoke command supports receiving events from the command line pipeline. We can generate events and pass them by executing the `scf native generate-event` command to form a debug command such as `scf native generate-event cos post | scf native invoke --template template.yaml` . We can also construct the output JSON format content and pass it to the `scf native invoke` command to form a debug command such as `echo '{"test":"value"}' | scf native invoke --template template.yaml `.
- ** Passing the file: ** Specify the file containing the contents of the test simulation event by using the `--event` parameter of the `scf native invoke` command. The file content must be a JSON data structure, forming a debug command such as `scf native invoke --template template.yaml --event event.json` .

### Use example

The sample project that was initialized by `scf init` has the prepared code file and template configuration file. Taking the example project as an example, assume that a hello_world project is created in the /Users/xxx/code/scf directory under the environment Node.js 8.9.

We pass the simulation event of the cos post file through the command pipeline, triggering the function to run. The function code content only prints the event and returns "hello world". The function code /Users/xxx/code/scf/testproject/hello_world/main.js is as follows:

```

'use strict';
exports.main_handler = async (event, context, callback) => {
    console.log("%j", event);
    return "hello world"
};

```

1. The startup function runs locally by executing the `scf native generate-event cos post | scf native invoke --template template.yaml` command:

```bash
Enter a event: [0m
START RequestId: 3e3e71c9-dc56-1967-c0a3-3a454e2ce634

"hello world"
```

As you can see from the output, after the function finishes running locally, it outputs the print log of the function and the function return content.

1. Generate the following event.json test event file:

```json
{
"key1":"value1",
"key2":"value2"
}
```

1. By executing the `scf native invoke --template template.yaml --event event.json` command, the startup function runs locally and outputs test events via a file:

```bash
Enter a event: [0m
START RequestId: 6d06b0cf-4cc9-1f76-5f92-1f5871ff110a
{"key1":"value1","key2":"value2"}

Billed Duration: 100 ms Memory Size: 128 MB     Max Memory Used: 20 MB

"hello world"
```

As you can see from the output, the function code prints the test event and returns the specified content.
