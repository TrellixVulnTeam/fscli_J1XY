The template file is the configuration file used to define the function, usually placed in the function project directory. Template files can be managed along with function code, test event files, and through code management tools. Currently, template files support the [YAML](http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/) format. The specification of the template file uses the [Tencent Cloud Serverless Application Model (TCSAM) ](https://github.com/tencentyun/scfcli/blob/master/docs/specs/tencentcloud%20sam%20version%202018-11-11-zh-cn.md).

## Sample file content

Template files are used to describe configuration information such as functions and their associated triggers. This document uses a simple template file as an example. An example is as follows:

```
Resources:
  default:
    Type: TencentCloud::Serverless::Namespace
    hello_world:
      Type: TencentCloud::Serverless::Function
      Properties:
        CodeUri: ./hello_world
        Description: This is a template function
        Environment:
          Variables:
            ENV_FIRST: env1
            ENV_SECOND: env2
        Handler: index.main_handler
        MemorySize: 128
        Runtime: Python3.6
        Timeout: 3
Globals:
  Function:
    Timeout: 10

```

This example specifies the function name hello_world and the related functions of the entry function main.main_handler, runtime Python3.6, code file location, environment variables, memory size, timeout, and so on.

## File structure

The YAML format uses a hierarchical structure to define nested content.

For details of each level, including values, refer to the definition of [TCSAM](https://github.com/tencentyun/scfcli/blob/master/docs/specs/tencentcloud%20sam%20version%202018-11-11-zh-cn.md) .
